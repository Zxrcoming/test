This is my plan for the vacation.

First of all, I have to do what I can do reach the ideal dream for myself.Here are the details.

1.get up everyday at 7:00 AM,and making breakfast for my family and eat for good.And remember to remind my grandma for medicine which is essential for health.

2.During the morning, you MUST help family do the choir and make your family more comfortable.Just do WHAT YOU CAN TO REACH THE GOAL.

3.And As for the launch, DO it mostly by yourself and making it delicious to let your family happy.IN SHORT, making the launch and rest your family.

4.After noon, washing the plates.And having a great talk with your family and comfort the one who is very important for you.And you can have some fun outside,but remember to come back home as early as you can .

5.Night, Making super is your job,and watching TV with your loved ones.Do not messing with your computer otherwise you will be staying up much late and you will not get up as early as you can,So, Computer works should be done in the afternoon when you are out for fun and at the same time for studying.

6.The most important thing is GETING UP EARLY AND SLEEP AT NIGHT EAELY TOO !!!!!----that is the very very basic thing you MUST do for the foundations of other things.

****YOU MUST trust yourself and do exactly what you want and must do-*****


I WILL DO --- I promise myself.
